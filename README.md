You might have got this if you are using an adblocker on YouTube, such as uBlock. It's annoying and it also delays video start.

Don't worry, the JellyBully Hider extension will hide it, before it is even showing up.

# Tutorial
1. Enable Developer Mode (go to chrome://extension, and toggle Developer Mode on.)
2. Download the ZIP and extract it using your extraction software (such as 7-Zip, WinRAR, etc.)
3. Click "Load unpacked", and select the extracted "JellyBullyHider" folder.
4. Refresh the browser.
5. Open YouTube with an adblocker and try to watch a video.
6. You're done.

NOTE: Chromium-based browsers (such as Chrome, Edge) might nag you with the message "Disable developer mode extensions". Just ignore that. Also, this extension **DOESN'T** fix the delay start issue.

If it is not working, create a new issue.
