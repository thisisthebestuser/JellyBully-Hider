You might have got this if you are using an adblocker on YouTube, such as uBlock. It's annoying and it also delays video start.

Don't worry, the JellyBully Hider extension will hide it, before it is even showing up.

# Tutorial
1. Enable Developer Mode (go to chrome://extension, and toggle Developer Mode on.)
2. Download the ZIP and extract it using your extraction software (such as 7-Zip, WinRAR, etc.)
3. Click "Load unpacked", and select the extracted "JellyBullyHider" folder.
4. Refresh the browser.
5. Open YouTube with an adblocker and try to watch a video.
6. You're done.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This does not fix the buffering issue. If you want a script, or an extension that fully removes both this message and the buffering, search up.

> [!NOTE]
> Chromium-based browsers (such as Chrome, Edge) might pop up this message: "Disable developer mode extensions" upon startup.

If it is not working, create a new issue.
